//c++ is object oriented language
//c++ = c with classes
//function is basic unit of functional programming language
//classes is only blueprint not it actully exit ,what actually exit is object
//Application of c++
//adobe system, maya
//Tokens: Smallest element of a program that a compiler can understand
//keywords: pedefined meaning
//Constants:fixed value that do not change during execution of program
//const int x;the thing with conat variable is that they should we inilize at the same place where it declare ,so this is wrong
//const int x=10;this is  write method
//strings:array of character 
//identifiers:refers to the name of variable ,classes ,structures ,function,array
//identifier can not use keyword
//special symbol * [] {} . , ~
//Operator
//Unary ++ --
//binary + - % && || & |
//ternary condition? statement1:statement2
//Declaration vs Defination
// declaration just informing compiler about variable 
//defining is allocating memory to variable
// extern int x; just informing compiler that it is defined in someother file and no memory is allocated
//Data types:size and operation
//fundamental data type:bool,char,int ,float,double
//derived datat type:pointers,array ,reference
// user defined data type : structure ,classes ,enums, tpedef
//bool:true,false
//boolz=x==y;if x==y then z=true and if x!=y then z=false
//bool :1 byte
//integer data tyoe size depend upon size of operating system for example 16bit os have 2 byte int ,32 bit os have 4 byte, 64 bit os have 8 byte int
//float 4byte and double 8 byte
//no. of values that a data type can store=2^(8*no of bytes of tha data type)
//wchar_t=2 bytes char data type
//Qualifier:short,long ,signed,unsigned
//Short unsigned int x;
//for this long declaration we can use short name with the help of typedef:typedef short unsigned int ui; now i can use it as ui x,y;
// enumeration:we decalre a data type person and person can have sit , hand ,walk:enum person {sit,hand, walk};
//enum person {sit=2 ,stand=3 ,walk=6} p;
//if we print p=sit;cout<<p;2 is printed
// p is data type of person
//Arithmetic operator:+,-,/,*,%
//Relational operators:comparison,>,<,==,!=,>=,<=
//Logical operators:&&,||,!
//bitwise operators:&,|,^,~,<<,>>
//other operator:sizeof,ternary,assignment operator,increament and decreament
//postfix:X++,x--
//prefix:--x,++x
//sizeof(a)=it gives me size of data type of that which a is
//bitwise operators
//x=10,y=25 then x&y=8 because x in binary form 00001010 and y  is 00011001 then after doing bit by bit and operation we get 00001000 we get 8
//x=00010011,x<<2:01001100 and x>>2:00000100
//left shift x<<n is equal to x*2^n;
//right shift x>>n is equal to 2^n;
//~x it  convert 0 to 1 and 1 to 0
//^ xor:x^y it can we find by following method:0 and 1 give 1 while if both 0 or both 1 then it give 0 value
//ternary operator
//(condition?print Ram:Print Sita ):it is same as if(condition) print Ram else print Sita
//operator precedence:it determine which operator is performed first in an expression
//Associativity:it is used when two operators of same precedance appear in an expression .it can be either left to right or right to left
//right to left associativity operator:unary operator(++ -- !), assignment operator(+= -= *= /= &= ^= |=)
//selection statements:if,if else ,else if ,switch
//iteration statements
//switch for several cases
//switch case statement is constant that mean int,char ,enum
//do{ statement}(condition);even the conditon is not follow statement is going to  execute
//body of do while runs at least once
//for loop :for(initialization;conditon ;update){statement}
//break:the loops get terminated and we are the outside of the loop
//continue:escapes the particular iteration on which condition is satisfied
//function:predefined and user defined 
//function declaration: return type function name (data type parameters);
//function definition: return type function name (data type parameters name ){set of statements return statements}
//funciton calling :funciton name(list of parameters);
//
#include<iostream>//several function are predefined in library
using namespace std;//we club libraries in some namespace,for example here iostream library is present in std namespace 
int main()
{
    cout<<"Hello World";
    return 0;
}
